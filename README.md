## Using every element
### Why?  

For learning purposes, I'm making a pure HTML website containing all HTML elements in existence (hopefully organized enough). I'm not alone — [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/Overview.html) specs, and other similar resources, should help me along the way.

#### Why is there that there is a `styles` directory and a `scripts` directory present?  

This is primarily for practice reasons. However, I might add *some* CSS if it becomes necessary later on the project.

##### TODO:
- [x] Fix `<code>`;
- [x] Fix `<hr>` constant affirmations of "a line break was added";
- [x] Very. Slowly. Touch. JavaScript.
- [x] JavaScript is the best programming language in the world and I will develop a pure JavaScript application that solves hunger in the world right now!!!!
