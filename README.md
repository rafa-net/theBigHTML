# theBigHTML
## Using every element
### Why?  

For learning purposes, I'm making a pure HTML website containing all HTML elements in existence (hopefully organized enough). I'm not alone â€” [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/Overview.html) specs, and other similar resources, should help me along the way.

#### Why is there that there is a `styles` directory and a `scripts` directory present?  

This is primarily for practice reasons. However, I might add *some* CSS if it becomes necessary later on the project.

##### TODO:
- [x] Fix `<code>`;
- [x] Fix `<hr>` constant affirmations of "a line break was added";
- [x] Very. Slowly. Touch. JavaScript.
- [x] JavaScript is the best programming language in the world and I will develop a pure JavaScript application that solves hunger in the world right now!!!!

- [x] Further organize document.
- [x] Create top nav bar.
- [x] Look at `<canvas>` and hopefully WebGL

###### Personal TO-DO: quick detour
I am working on The Odin Project, freeCodeCamp, MDN, W3Schools, Khan Academy and [ossu](https://github.com/ossu). Man pages and classic college books as well, I go through these regularly. I went ahead and read only 1/3 of C++ Primer and it was already so so valuable. However, I am focusing on Web Dev atm, it seems like everything wants to run on the web these days, and hardware really is expensive:
- [ ] Fork MDN repo, The Odin Project repo, freeCodeCamp repo
- [ ] Watch all freeCodeCamp YouTube videos
- [ ] Finish all Khan Academy math course
- [ ] Scrape all Web Development resources in existence (that are good) because this is very fun.
- [ ] Further organize bookmarks (terse names; comprehensive; usage of tags; like a mechanic's toolbox)
