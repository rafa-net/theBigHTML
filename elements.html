		<span class="comment-green">&lt;!-- This is a comment. We know what a comment is. It documents code, but affects it not. --&gt;</span><br><br>
		
		<!-- doctype declaration -->
    <span class="elementTitle" id="2">Initial document type declaration:</span>
    <span class="elementExplanation">The <span class="code-green">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> declaration. It has to be present on the very start of all HTML documents. No questions asked. This isn't the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> element <i>per se</i>. However, now that I think of it, <span class="gradient">this entire page could be considered contents of that one single element</span> (further still, children of <span class="code-green">&lt;html&gt;</span>)</b>. This text itself you are reading now is just wrapped around <span class="code-green">&lt;span&gt;</span> tags.</p>
		
		<!-- <a>  -->
		<span>The <span class="code-green">&lt;a&gt;</span> element is for placing links in a page, and it stands for <span class="orange-shadow">anchor</span>. It has all sorts of different attributes and interesting features. I am not wrapping all this content in <span class="code-green">&lt;a&gt;</span> tags, for it would look very silly. Here's what it looks like <a href="https://www.google.com">by default</a>.</p>

		<!-- <abbr> -->
		<span>The acronym in the next sentence is wrapped in <span class="code-green">&lt;abbr&gt;</span> tags: The National Health Service (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>), is the publicly funded healthcare system in England...</p>
			
    <!-- <address> -->
		<address>
			This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;address&gt;</span> element. <br> </span>
			Contact me @ <a href="mailto:rbueno.100.b@gmail.com">gerald-phs</a>.<br>
			789 Oak St, Nowhere, TX 34567
			USA
		</address><br>
		
		<!-- <area> -->
		<span>The <span class="code-green">&lt;area&gt;</span> element. Image maps and clickable areas.</span>
		
    <!-- <article> -->
		<article>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;article&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands on its own two feet, and, in my own words, could be safely extracted from the webpage and the latter would not lose its essential conveyance meaning.</article><br>
		
    <!-- <aside> -->
		<aside>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;aside&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands aside from the document's main content, like a sidebar for example.</aside>

		<!-- <audio> -->
			These are <span class="code-green">&lt;audio&gt;</span> elements.

		<!-- <b> -->
		<b>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;b&gt;</span> element.</b><br>

		<!-- <base> -->
		<span>The &lt;base&gt; element specifies a default URL and a default target (the "way" the link will open) for all links on a page. It is placed within the &lt;head&gt; element. It's like setting a custom home directory: <code>~/</code>, an absolute address serving as a reference (absolute) to all other links on a page (relative).</span>
		
		<!-- <bdi> and <bdo> explanations -->
			<span class="txt">For languages that are written right-to-left, e.g. Hebrew or Arabic, HTML's got us covered with &lt;bdi&gt; (Bi-Directional Isolation) and &lt;bdo&gt; (Bi-Directional Override). The former will format Arabic or Hebrew text (that is written right-to-left) to comply with the other, left-to-right languages, so that HTML does not render it all broken and stuff. And <i>vice versa</i> too, maybe there's an Arabic article containing the name <code>John Doe</code>, which is English, which is written left-to-right. As a result, so as not to experience undefined behaviour, we would wrap <code>John Doe</code> in &lt;bdi&gt; tags. It would then show up very nicely on the page. (Author's note: I've read somewhere japanese newspapers are read top-to-bottom.)</span>
		<input type="checkbox">TODO: Place examples.

		<!-- <bdo> -->
			<p>This is left-to-right text, wrapped in &lt;p&gt;tags.</p>
		<p><bdo dir="rtl">&lt;bdo dir="rtl"&gt;This is right-to-left text, also wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags.&lt;/bdo&gt;</bdo></p>

		<!-- <body> -->
			<span class="txt">This whole thing we're looking at are the contents of a &lt;body&gt; element. Here's a brief illustration of an HTML document:</span>

		<!-- <pre> contents START -->		
			<pre class="markUp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
					
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Local Developer Bakes Cake and Invites Neighbors to Eat Together&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They all broke bread together, talked nonsense and had a merry time. The cake tasted delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</pre><br>
		<!-- <pre> contents END -->		

		<!-- <br> -->
		<p>A line break can be added in HTML, too. Just like if we'd pressed <span class="buttonRtrn">Return ↩</span> on our keyboards, by using the <span class="code-green">&lt;br&gt;</span> element. It does not need a closing tag (it is a void element.)</p>

		<!-- <button> is related to <form> and there are a lot of attributes to cover. Let's just list the two most interesting ones. We'll come back to do forms later. -->
		<p>What follows is the <span class="code-green">&lt;button&gt;</span> element. Its content is the following text: <code>noodles</code>. Let's see if it works.</span> <button type="button">noodles</button></p>
		
		<!-- <canvas> -->
		<span class="txt">The &lt;canvas&gt; element defines an area on the page so that we can draw all sorts of stuff on it by writing JavaScript. <del>This is out of the scope of this manual.</del> (Update: I have actually understood, albeit superficially, what the code that generated that small yellow rectangle within the bigger, prettier rectangle below does! Although uglier, the former was way harder to generate than the latter.) Still, this is <code>theBigHTML</code>. No JS.) Contents within <span class="code-green">&lt;canvas&gt;</span> are only shown if the browser accessing the page does not support it (as a fallback warning) <b>OR</b> if I add some CSS to it??? This is the HTML manual <em>thing</em>. We are scientists. Science demands <strong>TESTING!</strong> Anyway, here's <span class="code-green">&lt;canvas&gt;</span>:</span><br>

		<canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="150">
			Your browser does not support the canvas element.
		</canvas>
		<script>
			const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
			const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
			ctx.fillStyle = "gold";
			ctx.fillRect(100, 10, 150, 75);
			</script>

<!-- <caption> -->
	<span class="txt">The <span class="code-green">&lt;caption&gt;</span> element is used together with the "<span class="code-green">&lt;table&gt;</span>" element, nested within it, upon creation of a table, to provide a description (hence "caption") for the table in question. Here it is in action:</span><br>
	<span class="txt">No <span class="code-green">&lt;caption&gt;</span>.</span>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Energy</th>
			<th>Water</th>
				<th>Phone Bill</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>10$</td>
				<td>20$</td>
				<td>30$</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br><br>
		<span class="txt"><span class="code-green">&lt;caption&gt;</span> is present with a 2 pixel-wide border.</span>
		<table>
			<caption>Monthly Expenditures</caption>
			<tr>
				<th>Energy</th>
				<th>Water</th>
				<th>Phone Bill</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>10$</td>
				<td>20$</td>
				<td>30$</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<cite>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;cite&gt;</span> element. It is used to mark up the title of a creative work: a mural, a poem, a painting, a movie etc. It is italicized by HTML to emphasize the title. Also, in textbooks and scientific publications this convention is also followed, so it is natural that HTML would do so as well.</cite><br>
		
		<code>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;code&gt;</span> element. It is rendered using the browser's default monospace font, and it is for displaying computer code (let foo = 1;)</code><br>
		
		<!-- <col> and <colgroup> -->
			<span class="txt"><span class="code-green">&lt;col&gt;</span> and 
		<span class="code-green">&lt;colgroup&gt;</span> aren't "content containers", but instead serve the purpose of styling <span class="code-green">&lt;table&gt;</span> elements.

		<!-- <data> -->
			<data value="entry-1">
				This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;data&gt;</span> element.
				<blockquote cite="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_data.asp">
					This element provides both a machine-readable value for data processors, and a human-readable value for rendering in a browser. (Source: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_data.asp">W3Schools</a>)
			</blockquote>
		</data>
		
		<!-- <datalist> -->
			<span class="txt">The <span class="code-green">&lt;datalist&gt;</span> element is better understood in the context of collecting user input using HTML which I know how to do in the frontend, but I've never touched a server. Let's leave it at that.</span><br>
			<details>
				<summary>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;summary&gt;</span> element. It is also the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;details&gt;</span> element, for it is nested within <span class="code-green">&lt;detail&gt;</span> tags.</summary>
			This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;details&gt;</span> element. However, under no circumstances, can it be the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;summary&gt;</span> element, for its closing tag (<span class="code-green">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>) was already declared.
		</details>
		
		<!-- <dialog> + some JavaScript = DONE -->
			<p>Let's write some javascript.</p>
			<button onclick="mostraJanelinha()">ramen</button>
			<dialog id="janelinha">ramen is good food ✔️<br>
				<button onclick="document.getElementById('janelinha').close()">ok</button>
		</dialog>
		<script>function mostraJanelinha() {
			document.getElementById("janelinha").showModal();
		}
		</script>

    <div>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;div&gt;</span> element.</div>

		<!-- <dl>, <dd>, <dt> -->
		<dl>
			<dt>Chickens</dt>
			<dd>Very nice.</dd>
			<dt>Parrots</dt>
			<dd>I'll have to think about it (I'll get back to you)</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<del>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;del&gt;</span> element.</del>
		
		<p>The following word "noodles" is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;dfn&gt;</span> element. <dfn>noodles</dfn></p>

		<p>The following image is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;embed&gt;</span> element.
			<embed type="image/jpg" src="assets/Latte_and_dark_coffee.jpg" width="300" height="200">
				<br>
				The following webpage is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;embed&gt;</span> element. I think <span class="code-green">iframe</span> is better for this...but one ought to admire <span class="code-green">&lt;embed&gt;</span>'s versatility.
				<embed type="text/html" src="assets/embed-example.html" width="500" height="200">
		</p>
		
    <em>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;em&gt;</span> element.</em>

    <footer>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;footer&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used for the lower section of a webpage e.g. contact information, the page author's name and so on.</footer>
		

    <header>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;header&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used for the upper section of a webpage e.g. the navigation bar.</header>
		
    <main>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;main&gt;</span> element. Besides its  semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to specify  the main section of the webpage i.e. the “meat of the matter” itself. I don't know what will be the  correct situation: nesting sections and articles within main or nesting main within sections and   articles, but I bet the latter is wrong and probably considered bad practice.</main>

		<span class="txt">What follows is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;meter&gt;</span> element. It won't show up (as text, at least) but the “progress bar” it's supposed to render shows up alright:</span> 
		<meter value="75" min="0" max="100">Something is happening</meter>
		<span class="txt">As with <span class="code-green">&lt;a&gt;</span> and others, this is a very interesting element with some features. I will come back to this later to document it further.</span>
   
		<pre>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;pre&gt;</span> element.</pre><br>
		
    <section>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;section&gt;</span> element.</section>

    <small>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;small&gt;</span> element.</small><br>

    <span>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;span&gt;</span> element. (Note: no <span class="code-green">&lt;br&gt;</span> was added: <span class="code-green">&lt;div&gt;</span> is a block-level element).</span>

    <strong>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element.</strong><br>

		<sup>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;sup&gt;</span> element.</sup><br>

		<nav>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;nav&gt;</span> element.</nav>

		<mark>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;mark&gt;</span> element.</mark>

    <wbr>This is the content of the <span class="code-green">&lt;wbr&gt;</span>, which adds a line break whenever there's an opportunity, depending on the window size (and probably other factors).</wbr>
