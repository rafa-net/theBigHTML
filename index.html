		<h3>Initial Considerations</h3>
		<p>Lexicographers have to keep updating the dictionary to accomodate new slang, subcultural idioms, and different expressions, in order to maintain a categorical and trustworthy order, like a building, lest it falls apart due to its axiomatic structures being under duress. Otherwise, "Official Communication Letter to The United States Coast Guard" and "Fried Bananas Are Crazy My Name's Philip" may start to mean the same thing. In mathematics, there are axioms. In philosophy, there are axioms. In programming, there are also axioms. Therefore, in HTML, the <em>language of the web</em>, it should be no different. Rules, specifications, and standards exist. We should not be scared, but rather stand in awe of the marvelous abstract structural monument that was built, is being fixed daily, and is trusted by millions to keep working indefinitely (uptime-wise and future-wise). And it is freely available for our consultation. Therefore, if we are to call ourselves HTML professionals, there is categorically no other option than to peruse the sacred tomes...</p> 
		<p>Below, you will find brief descriptions of these remarkable institutions that I have collected from around the Web.</p>

		<span class="txt"><q>The <b><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></b> is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. As of 21 March 2022, W3C had 459 members. W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.</q></span>

    <span>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;span&gt;</span> element. (Note: no <span class="code-green">&lt;br&gt;</span> was added: <span class="code-green">&lt;div&gt;</span> is a block-level element).</span>
    <header>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;header&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used for the upper section of a webpage e.g. the navigation bar.</header>
    <footer>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;footer&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used for the lower section of a webpage e.g. contact information, the page author's name and so on.</footer>
    <main>This is the content of a <span class="code-green">&lt;main&gt;</span> element. Besides its  semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to specify  the main section of the webpage i.e. the “meat of the matter” itself. I don't know what will be the  correct situation: nesting sections and articles within main or nesting main within sections and   articles, but I bet the latter is wrong and probably considered bad practice.</main>

  <br><br>
  <span>The <span class="code-green">&lt;a&gt;</span> element is for placing links in a page, and it stands for <span class="orange-shadow">anchor</span>. It has all sorts of different attributes and interesting features. Here's what it looks like <a href="https://www.google.com">by default</a>.</span>

  <p>The acronym in the next sentence is wrapped in <span class="code-green">&lt;abbr&gt;</span> tags: The National Health Service (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>), is the publicly funded healthcare system in England...</p>

  <article>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;article&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands on its own two feet, and, in my own words, could be safely extracted from the webpage and the latter would not lose its essential conveyance meaning.</article>
  <br>
  <aside>This is the content of an <span class="code-green">&lt;aside&gt;</span> element. Besides its semantic function (which is to inform us about the nature of its contents), it's also used to represent a section in a webpage that stands aside from the document's main content, like a sidebar for example.</aside>

    <span class="txt">It looks like <span class="code-green">&lt;p&gt;</span> is a block-level element:   it creates a rectangular block on the page that takes up the <b>full width</b> of its  <span class="gradient">parent container</span> and causes a <span class="orange-shadow">line break</span> before and after itself (just like when we do <span class="code-green">&lt;br&gt;</span>)<a  href="#newline"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</span>
