        The spoken language is alive: and it comes up with 
        all sorts of creative ways to resist entropy. It'll 
        change and adapt. Therefore, lexicographers have to 
        keep updating the dictionary to accomodate new slang, 
        subcultural idioms, and different expressions, in order 
        to maintain a solid abstract structure, like a building 
        itself, lest it falls apart due to its axiomatic postulations 
        being under duress.<br> <b><i>What if:</i></b>

            We are Captain Barbossa and 30 souls (mostly sailors) 
            onboard <i>USS Stormrider</i>. All seawater has turned 
            <span class=xa>red</span> — as far as the eye can see.
            NS Rick Scallywag had his eyes on what appeared to be
            a demonic monster emerging from the depths, almost as if 
            from Davy Jones' locker itself, its scales glistening in 
            the moonlight amidst this blood-red vastness. No man in this 
            vessel has ever seen the likes of such terror before. Silence 
            is imposed on all frequencies.<br><br> 
            Esteemed Governor, this is Captain Barbossa.<br><br>
            Please send a priest.

          May start to mean the same thing. In mathematics, there are axioms. 
          In philosophy, there are axioms. In programming, there are also axioms. 
          Therefore, in HTML, the <em>language of the web</em>, it should be no 
          different. Rules, specifications, and standards exist. We should not be 
          scared, but rather stand in awe of the marvelous abstract structural 
          monument that was built, is being fixed daily, and is trusted by millions 
          to keep working indefinitely (uptime-wise and future-wise). And it is 
          freely available for our consultation. Therefore, if we are to call ourselves 
          HTML professionals, I see no way forward than to peruse the sacred tomes...
